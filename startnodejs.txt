To start the Next.js app without the .next and node_modules directories, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

Remove the .next and node_modules directories:

rm -rf .next node_modules


Install the dependencies again:

npm install

Start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev

These commands will clean up the build artifacts and dependencies, reinstall the necessary packages, and start the development server.
